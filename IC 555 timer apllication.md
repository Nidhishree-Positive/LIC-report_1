# Design and Simulation of 555 Timer-Based Astable and Monostable Multivibrators for Pulse Generation and Width Control Applications

## Introduction
The 555 timer integrated circuit (IC) is one of the most popular and versatile components used in analog electronics. It was introduced by Signetics in 1972 and has since found widespread applications in timers, oscillators, pulse generation, and waveform shaping circuits. The 555 timer can operate primarily in three modes: astable, monostable, and bistable. In this project, we focus on the astable and monostable modes to generate precise pulse waveforms and control pulse widths for applications such as pulse width modulation (PWM), timing delays, and triggering circuits.

The objective of this project is to design and simulate two experimental setups using the 555 timer IC in LTspice simulation software. The first setup is an astable multivibrator generating a PWM waveform with a fixed pulse width of approximately 0.5 milliseconds. The second setup is a monostable multivibrator triggered by the output of the astable circuit after passing through a differentiator and clipper stage. The monostable circuit produces a single output pulse whose width can be varied externally by changing component values.

By simulating these circuits, we aim to understand the working principles of the 555 timer in generating and controlling pulse signals and to explore the practical aspects of triggering monostable pulses from an astable source.
