# Differential amplifier -Design in LTspice using 180nm technology library


A differential amplifier is a type of electronic amplifier that amplifies the difference between two input voltages while rejecting any voltage that is common to both inputs. It is widely used in analog circuits, particularly in operational amplifiers (op-amps) and instrumentation systems.



## Key Characteristics:
- **Differential Mode Operation:** Amplifies the voltage difference between two inputs:  
  \[
  V_{out} = A_d (V_1 - V_2)
  \]
  where \( A_d \) is the differential gain.
- **Common-Mode Rejection:** It rejects common signals that appear on both inputs.
- **High Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR):** Useful in reducing noise.
- **Applications:** Used in **signal processing, sensor interfacing, audio amplification, and operational amplifiers**.
